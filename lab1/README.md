There is a sequence of arbitrary integer non-zero numbers, in
range from -3200 to +3200, ending with the number 0, to generate
random numbers using the built-in Mersenne Twist algorithm.
The sequence may contain repeated numbers. Maximum
the number of elements in the sequence is unknown, so
the sequence must be put into a vector.
Find the sum of elements that consist of two equal parts
and have the number 3 in their composition. Example: 4343 9131 33 3313
646 3223 1313 0. Result: 4343 + 66 + 1313 = 5689

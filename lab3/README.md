You need to create a calculator, an analogue of a regular calculator
under Windows. The interface can be changed, the main implementation of the key
functions. A prerequisite is to create an application using
C++ language, you can create an application in several ways, most
simple is through "CLR Empty Project".

This task has two difficulty levels: </br>
1. Implementation of a simple calculator as in the screenshot above, i.e. to you
it is necessary to implement a set of buttons for entering numbers and arithmetic
operations, intermediate calculation interface and the answer itself (3 points). </br>
2*. A calculator capable of parsing mathematical expressions.
A parser is a program that parses an input arithmetic
expression. Programs of this class are sometimes called the same
"recognisers".</br>
Parsing is the process of parsing an input arithmetic expression into
simpler ingredients.</br>
Example: https://habr.com/ru/post/263775/</br>
A window should be implemented in which you can enter an expression,
e.g. sin(x)*5*(5x+7).</br>
Also a window for entering the value of the variable x.</br>
The result of the evaluated value of the expression.</br>

The rules for entering expressions must comply with the standards.
This problem can be solved using OOP classes or structures
each of which will store information either about the operation or about
the value of the variable. Implement a choice of 10 functions from the presented
list below (simple arithmetic expressions are ignored).

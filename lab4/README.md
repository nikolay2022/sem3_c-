In this work, you are given a covid.csv file, which contains only two
column: date and number of new cases on that day in Russia.
CSV (from English Comma-Separated Values - values ​​separated
commas) is a text format intended to represent
tabular data. A row in the table corresponds to a line of text that
contains one or more fields separated by commas.
**Exercise 1**
Read the csv file data in any format convenient for you, think over
efficient way to store such data in computer memory.
Visualize the presented data, build a dependency graph
number of new cases since date. Plot the date on the x-axis
along the y-axis, the number of new cases.
**Task 2**
On your local machine, deploy the DBMS (unprincipled
which one, but PostgreSQL is better). Load file data into table, execute
connection with the database using the C++ language. Visualize data similarly
task 1.
In the final program, you should have two buttons, each of which
is responsible for its own version of uploading data for visualization.
